# charging-station-availability-checker
This project is a tool to check the availability of charging ports at vehicle battery charging stations before visiting. It helps users find compatible and available charging ports and report issues directly to the charging station company.

## Background
With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) globally, the demand for accessible and efficient charging infrastructure has increased significantly. However, one of the major challenges faced by EV users is the uncertainty of charging port availability when planning their routes or daily travel.

Unlike traditional fuel stations with multiple pumps and quick refuelling times, EV charging stations often have limited charging ports and longer charging durations. This limitation can result in:

Long waiting times, especially during peak hours.

Range anxiety, where drivers fear their battery will deplete before reaching an available charger.

Inefficient trip planning, affecting both personal schedules and commercial operations (e.g., EV taxis, delivery fleets).

Although modern charging networks provide apps and websites to check real-time availability, data accuracy, user interface design, and integration with vehicle systems remain inadequate in many regions. Some stations do not update availability in real time, and different apps provide fragmented data, causing user frustration and wasted time.

Furthermore, compatibility issues with charging port types (e.g., Type 2, CCS, CHAdeMO) exacerbate the problem if a driver reaches a station only to find incompatible chargers, even if available.

Therefore, researching methods to effectively check and integrate charging port availability data before visiting is critical. It will:

Enhance user convenience and confidence in EV usage.

Improve the efficiency of public charging infrastructure utilization.

Reduce waiting times and avoid unnecessary congestion at charging stations.

Contribute towards smoother adoption of electric vehicles by addressing operational pain points.

## Why This Research is Important
The solution to this problem directly supports sustainable transport goals by encouraging EV adoption through improved infrastructure usability. Developing advanced systems for availability checking, accurate data integration, and user-friendly interfaces will ensure:

Better resource management for charging station operators.

Higher satisfaction rates among EV owners.

Contributions to national and global carbon emission reduction targets.

## Research Question
✅ How to Check the Availability of a Charging Port at a Vehicle battery Charging Station Before Visiting?

## Research Objectives
To analyse the current methods and technologies used to check charging port availability at vehicle battery charging stations.

To identify the limitations and challenges faced by EV users when checking charging port availability before visiting a station.

To investigate user requirements and expectations for an effective charging port availability checking system.

To design and propose a solution or framework that provides real-time, accurate, and user-friendly charging port availability information.

To evaluate the proposed solution's effectiveness in improving user experience and reducing waiting times at charging stations.

## Frontend
React.js — For building a fast, interactive user interface

Tailwind CSS or Material UI — For responsive, clean design components

Axios or Fetch API — To handle API requests for real-time data

## Libraries for React
Google Maps React libraries: @react-google-maps/api — modern, maintained React wrapper for Google Maps

## Backend
Node.js + Express.js — Lightweight, scalable backend server to handle API requests

RESTful API or GraphQL — For communication between frontend and backend

WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) — For real-time updates on charger availability

## MongoDB (NoSQL Document Database)
Stores data as flexible JSON-like documents (great for varying charging station info).

Easy to scale horizontally for growing data and users.

Works well with real-time data and geospatial queries (locations).

Strong community and good integration with Node.js.
